Project template “8.2 Project Idea 2: Towards a Low-cost Resilient Early-warning Natural Disaster Monitoring, Notification and Rapid Response Platform” was selected as the foundation. This template was chosen because it aligned directly with two key areas of interest: the technical challenge of advancing Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, and the broader societal imperative of safeguarding vulnerable populations in disaster contexts. My motivation was also shaped by the escalating reality that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe as a result of climate change [17].
Hypothesis
If an early warning system for natural disasters is designed using affordable, modular IoT components and prioritises inclusive communication especially through wearable, multimodal alert devices and non internet dependent protocols then it will demonstrate improved accessibility, usability, and reliability for vulnerable and underrepresented populations, particularly in scenarios where traditional mobile/ cellular based alerts fail.

Aims
This project aims to design and prototype a low-cost, resilient, and inclusive early warning system (EWS) for flood detection and public notification, with a specific focus on improving communication with vulnerable and underrepresented groups. It integrates IoT technologies, machine learning for early prediction, and accessible, wearable-based alert mechanisms to ensure no individual is excluded from receiving potentially life-saving information.
The four thematic pillars are:

Low Cost – Utilise open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and simple deployment frameworks.
Resilient – Implement robust communication protocols and power-efficient design.
Early Warning & Notification – Enable real-time flood detection and predictive alerting.
Rapid Response – Facilitate location-aware, multi-sensory alerting to aid swift evacuation and rescue.

Objectives
Review and critically analyse current IoT-based EWS literature and implementations, identifying socio-technical shortcomings in alert delivery and inclusivity.
Design and build a modular IoT prototype capable of flood detection using cost-effective sensors and real-time data processing.
Implement a wearable alert system incorporating multimodal output (visual, auditory, and haptic) using low-power, long-range communication technologies such as LoRa.
Ensure system resilience and security, adopting modern encryption.
Evaluate system performance under controlled, simulated conditions using usability studies, power profiling, and communication range/stability testing.
Scope
This project focuses on designing and prototyping a localised flood warning system suitable for deployment in remote, digitally disconnected, or vulnerable communities. The emphasis is on:
Hardware prototyping: Limited to the creation of a wearable pendant-style alert device and a stationary flood sensor node.
Communication: Emphasis on non-internet protocols (e.g. LoRa), assuming potential loss of internet connectivity during disasters.
Machine Learning: Focus on lightweight models suitable for deployment on microcontrollers or edge devices, using open-source datasets.
Target Users: Older adults, individuals with disabilities, and digitally excluded users in high-risk flood-prone areas.
Testing Environment: Simulated lab conditions with basic field testing for alert range, power efficiency, and usability.

Exclusions:
Real-world deployment.
Legal or regulatory certification.
Comprehensive field testing across multiple flood scenarios.
Remote power sources will not be included in the scope of this project.
